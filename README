Description:
To simplify the usage of the vdr-plugin dbus2vdr this library offers
a wrapper interface around the DBus-API of dbus2vdr.
It uses GDBus, the DBus implementation of GLib/GIO.
It is fully asynchronous.
And you need a GMainLoop.

Just have a look at the examples directory, I will try to keep it
up to date.

Have fun!
  Lars.
